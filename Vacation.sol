      STRANDED by Johan Berntsson, Fredrik Ramsberg, and Staffan Friberg
          A solution and walkthrough by Johan Berntsson, July 1997
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
When the game starts you find that your family is gone. Your first objective
is to find out their whereabouts.

  southwest
  examine table
  read note

Now you know where they are, and you have a task to do. But it is cold outside
so we'll find us a sweater first.

  northeast
  open closet
  search clothes
  wear sweater
  southwest
  south
  open car
  enter it
  start it
  south
  south

Surprise! Without your doing you have been caught up in a difficult situation.
Not helping the aliens will mean death to many people, including your family,
so you'd better try to enter the research centre they told you about.

  start car
  west
  get out
  northwest
  west
  open trunk
  take sports bag

You will need a key to operate the rope-way, and there is a spare key hidden
in the cabin hall.

  examine sign
  look under it
  take key
  enter cabin car
  unlock panel with key
  press red button
  wait
  get out
  open toolchest
  take chain and nippers
  put chain and nippers in bag
  north

There are five persons working in the centre. Some of them don't do very
much, while others are much more flexible. If you have trouble finding a
person who is on the move, try waiting in the lab area (north, northwest
and north from the entrance), or in the kitchen.

The centre is tight on security, so you must bluff your way in. It is not too
difficult. Also ask the receptionist for some information

  examine glass box
  examine name tag
  say hans leibach to henkel
  ask henkel about sphere
  ask henkel about security lab

We now know that the sphere is in a security lab somewhere, and that some
codes will be needed to enter this lab.

Next we visit the guard office, before seeing Dr Williams.

  north
  east
  south
  examine monitor
  examine video
  north
  east
  east
  wait

The kitchen is in the south-west corner of the centre, and while we are on
the move we will pick up some other things which will be of later use.

  west
  west
  west
  west
  south (The bathroom might be occupied. In that case you have to wait.)
  open fuse vault
  take cigarette lighter and candle
  north
  west
  west
  take kettle
  open upper drawer
  take glass
  open lower drawer
  take knife and bottle
  open fridge
  take meat

Now we can use a nice feature to go back to Williams office. If you have
visited a place, you can use the "go to" command to get there.

  go to williams office
  give glass to williams
  wait

Williams will leave to fetch a paper in the reception. That whisky may come
in handy, and you now have the chance to obtain all of it.

  wait
  fill green bottle with whisky
  fill brown bottle with tea
  
Now wait until Williams gets back.

  wait
  read security document
  west
  north
  north
  east
  examine door

The door is locked and we don't have a key. But maybe it can be opened anyway.

  pull bolt with knife
  east
  examine desk
  examine basket
  take tainted paper
  read it

And what did we find, if not one of the codes. The code number is needed
later, so write down the numbers you find. Note that each game session uses
different codes.

Next we'll take a look outside.

  west
  north
  west
  north
  north
  northeast (we will open this door later)
  southwest
  southwest
  west

Some parrots can easily learn new phrases, and this parrot is intelligent
indeed. We'll also bring some tobacco, which will be of use later in the game.

  say code to parrot
  take packet
  east
  northeast
  north
  east
  west
  north  (to be able to return here later in the game)
  south
  southwest
  examine window

Big dogs can be quite frightning. But in Interactive Fiction there is a
solution to every problem.

  open window
  east
  throw meat through window
  push dog
  close window
  east
  open cupboard
  take overalls
  wear overalls
  west
  open window
  examine dog
  examine necklace
  examine box
  open box
  take small note
  read it
  west
  northeast

Now we have three out of four codes, but there is more to explore. On to
the castle!

  east
  east
  northeast
  north
  read sign
  north
  northwest
  take ladder
  southeast
  northeast
  north
  up
  southwest
  west
  raise ladder at shelves
  climb ladder
  take iron kettle
  down

During the war someone bobby-trapped the cupboard, and the work of disarming
it is left to you.

  examine cupboard
  examine hinges
  open cupboard
  enter it
  examine cupboard
  examine rear wall
  examine crack

The rear wall is in fact a hidden door, but opening it without closing the
cupboard will set off the trap.

  close cupboard
  push rear wall
  north
  examine bomb
  cut cord with nippers
  take bomb
  south
  open cupboard
  out

Now we got us a bomb. Let's continue exploring the castle

  take ladder
  east
  northeast
  down
  south

We'll need some water later, and snow is solid water.

  southwest
  fill iron kettle with snow
  northeast
  west
  put ladder in hole
  down
  west
  north
  drop iron kettle
  enter fireplace
  up
  examine nest
  take rusty key
  down
  get out
  examine me

You are dirty, and that will raise suspicion among the researchers at
the centre. You'd better get some water and clean yourself up.

  east
  take wood
  west
  put wood in fireplace
  take iron kettle
  put iron kettle on wood
  light wood
  wait
  wash me

Remember the storage door which was locked. The new key might fit.

  south
  east
  up
  go to exit
  north
  unlock storage door with rusty key
  northeast
  take sack
  open sack

Now let's go back to the centre and try to find the last code and
the security laboratory everyone is talking about.

   south
   south
   south
   west
   south
   south
   west
   examine steel door (we will leave this door for later)
   east
   examine camera
   east
   examine door
   examine lock

We have obviously found the security lab, but someone also found us.
We will be caught and brought to Williams, who will scold us, but
otherwise take no action this time. The problem is the video
monitoring system in Schwartz' office, and it is time to disable it.

[In Williams office, after trespassing discovered]

   go to exit
   south
   west
   take cigarette
   light it
   go to Schwartz office
   press stop
   press rewind
   press play
   examine monitor
   examine video

Now we can go to the cellar without questions being asked, but we
still have to find the last code. If you have been playing the game
before using this walkthrough, you have probably asked the persons
in the centre about themselves. It should then be clear that John
Fulham have had alcohol problems. Bringing him some booze might prove
useful, but the only alcohol here is Dr Williams' whisky bottle. We
must try to get it, without him noticing.

  go to williams office
  williams, give me whisky

He won't give you the bottle, but he left it on the table. Stealing it
is not a good idea, but have you thought about how similar whisky and
tea are in colour?

  put whisky in green bottle
  put tea in brown bottle

Now we try to find John. If not there already, he is bound to return
to the lab sooner or later.

  west
  north
  west
  north
  wait (until John comes)
  give whisky to John

John is drunk, and it is well known that drunk people can't keep secrets.

  ask John about code

We have all the codes! At last we can get the sphere.

   go to cellar
   east
   type <first code> on keypad
   type <second code> on keypad
   type <third code> on keypad
   type <forth code> on keypad

The door to the security lab opens.

   east
   take sphere
   put sphere in sack

We have the sphere and the metal foil of the sack will protect us from
its radioactivity. Now we have to get back to the aliens somehow. The
rope-way can't be used, since Henkel is controlling it and can't be persuaded
cooperate. You'll have to find another way out and the bomb will be handy.
But to ignite the bomb we need a power source.

  west
  west
  west
  wait (until Petra arrives. She will open the cellar door for you)
  south
  examine door
  examine bolt pocket
  cut candle with knife
  put plug in bolt pocket
  north
  wait (until Petra has left)
  south
  take battery

There is nothing more to do in the centre. Time to find a way out.

  go to toolshed
  take padlock
  start scooter
  enter scooter
  south
  east
  south
  southeast
  get out
  east
  examine grating

If only the grating could be opened...

  look through grating
  tie chain to grating
  open window
  throw chain at window
  west
  enter scooter
  southeast
  tie chain to scooter
  south

Now a new passage is revealed.

  northwest
  east
  down
  south
  examine iron door
  open iron door

If nothing else works, we can always try brute force.

  connect bomb to battery
  south
  up
  up
  enter car
  start it
  east

The aliens can repair their ship and many people, including your family and
the people at the research centre, are saved from potential disaster.
Well done!
